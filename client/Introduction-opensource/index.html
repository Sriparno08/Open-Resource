        <h3>What does Open-source mean?</h3>
        <div class="card">
            <p>Open source refers to a development methodology where the source code of a software project is made
                freely available to the public. Unlike proprietary software, which is typically developed and owned by a
                single entity, open source projects invite a global community of contributors to collaborate and improve
                the software collectively.
                <br><br>
                At the heart of open source is transparency. The source code, which serves as the blueprint for any
                software, is open and accessible to anyone interested. This transparency fosters trust, as users can
                inspect, modify, and share the code. It's like having the recipe for your favorite dish ‚Äì you can tweak
                it to suit your taste or share it with others to create new variations.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">

            <ul>
                <h4> Some famous examples of Open-source products are : </h4>
                <br>
                <li><b>Operating systems</b></li>
                Android, Ubuntu, Linux
                <li><b>Internet browsers</b></li>
                Mozilla Firefox, Chromium
                <li><b> Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) </b></li>
                Vs code (Visual Studio Code), Android Studio, PyCharm, Xcode
            </ul>
            </p>
        </div>


        <h3>Open-source community and Contributions :</h3>
        <div class="card">
            <p>The open-source community is a worldwide community of programmers and software developers who are
                continuously working on various open-source projects to make our lives better. This community is
                self-governing and self-organizing, there are no executives to take the decisions solely. This community
                plays a very crucial role in the sustainability of various open-source organizations.
                <br><br>
                The contributions made in any open-source project which improves its usability are called open-source
                contributions. These contributions can be of any form not only some software codes like we can work on
                improving its documentation, improving its UI/UX (user interface and design), organize meetups, or find
                new collaborators.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="card">
            <p>The philosophy of open source extends beyond software; it's a mindset that promotes openness,
                sharing, and collaboration. Open source projects are often governed by licenses that ensure the freedom
                to use, modify, and distribute the software. Popular licenses, such as the GNU General Public License
                (GPL) or the MIT License, provide a legal framework for maintaining the balance between openness and
                responsible use.
                <br><br>
                GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are platforms where many open source projects host their code
                repositories. These platforms facilitate version control, issue tracking, and collaboration among
                contributors. You'll find a plethora of projects spanning various domains, from operating systems like
                Linux to web frameworks like Django and content management systems like WordPress.
            </p>

        <h3>Benefits of Open-source contributions :</h3>
        <div class="card">
            <p>One of the key advantages of open source is the collaborative nature of development. People from diverse
                backgrounds, skill levels, and geographic locations come together to work on projects. This collective
                intelligence results in robust, innovative solutions that benefit from the wisdom of the crowd. Whether
                you're a seasoned developer, a designer, a tester, or just an enthusiast, there's a place for you in the
                open source community.</p>

            <ul style="line-height: 1.5rem; font-weight: 450;">
                <li>We code for real-world open-source projects.</li>
                <li>It refines our existing knowledge of programming and also helps us to learn new skills.</li>
                <li>Many open-source projects offer mentorship programs to guide and help us through our first few
                    contributions.</li>
                <li>We need not develop the whole thing from scratch, we just have to fork our favorite projects and
                    start
                    experimenting with them.</li>
                <li>After making any open-source contribution, we get immediate feedback regarding our developmental
                    work.</li>
                <li>While doing open-source contributions, we interact with like-minded developers from all over the
                    world
                    and build connections along the way.</li>
                <li>As we get more closer to the open-source community, we get to know much more about our field of
                    interest
                    and other related fields.</li>
                <li>The most important aspect of open-source contributions is It may fetch us a job in our field of
                    interest.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Hence, a large number of students are heading towards open-source contributions because these days
                quality
                open-source contributions in some good projects are seen as an alternative to the good internships with
                developer's profile. The reason is we get the same kind of exposure to work and learn the required
                skills
                for software development like any good internships at Google or Microsoft.

        <div class="card" style="background-color: rgb(255, 247, 99); color: rgb(3, 0, 98); font-weight: 500;">

            <p>To dive into open source, start by exploring projects that align with your interests or areas you want to
                learn more about. Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git and platforms like GitHub,
                as
                they are integral to the collaborative nature of open source development. Don't be afraid to ask
                questions,
                participate in discussions, and contribute in any way you can ‚Äì every contribution, no matter how small,
                is
                valuable. <br><br>
                As you immerse yourself in the open source community, you'll discover a rich ecosystem of learning
                resources, events, and supportive individuals who share a passion for openness and collaboration.
                Welcome to
                the world of open source - where innovation knows no bounds, and the collective effort of many shapes
                the
                future of technology!</p>
