      <h3 id="open">What does Open-source mean?</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>Open source refers to a development methodology where the source code of a software project is made
          freely available to the public. Unlike proprietary software, which is typically developed and owned
          by a
          single entity, open source projects invite a global community of contributors to collaborate and
          improve
          the software collectively.
          <br><br>
          At the heart of open source is transparency. The source code, which serves as the blueprint for any
          software, is open and accessible to anyone interested. This transparency fosters trust, as users can
          inspect, modify, and share the code. It's like having the recipe for your favorite dish – you can
          tweak
          it to suit your taste or share it with others to create new variations.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
        <ul>
          <h4> Some famous examples of Open-source products are : </h4>
          <br>
          <li><b>Operating systems</b></li>
          Android, Ubuntu, Linux
          <li><b>Internet browsers</b></li>
          Mozilla Firefox, Chromium
          <li><b> Integrated Development Environment (IDEs) </b></li>
          Vs code (Visual Studio Code), Android Studio, PyCharm, Xcode
        </ul>
        </p>
      </div>


      <h3 class="head">Open-source community and Contributions :</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>The open-source community is a worldwide community of programmers and software developers who are
          continuously working on various open-source projects to make our lives better. This community is
          self-governing and self-organizing, there are no executives to take the decisions solely. This
          community
          plays a very crucial role in the sustainability of various open-source organizations.
          <br><br>
          The contributions made in any open-source project which improves its usability are called
          open-source
          contributions. These contributions can be of any form not only some software codes like we can work
          on
          improving its documentation, improving its UI/UX (user interface and design), organize meetups, or
          find
          new collaborators.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>The philosophy of open source extends beyond software; it's a mindset that promotes openness,
          sharing, and collaboration. Open source projects are often governed by licenses that ensure the
          freedom
          to use, modify, and distribute the software. Popular licenses, such as the GNU General Public
          License
          (GPL) or the MIT License, provide a legal framework for maintaining the balance between openness and
          responsible use.
          <br><br>
          GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are platforms where many open source projects host their code
          repositories. These platforms facilitate version control, issue tracking, and collaboration among
          contributors. You'll find a plethora of projects spanning various domains, from operating systems
          like
          Linux to web frameworks like Django and content management systems like WordPress.
        </p>
      </div>



      <h3 class="head">Benefits of Open-source contributions :</h3>
      <div class="card">
        <p>One of the key advantages of open source is the collaborative nature of development. People from
          diverse
          backgrounds, skill levels, and geographic locations come together to work on projects. This
          collective
          intelligence results in robust, innovative solutions that benefit from the wisdom of the crowd.
          Whether
          you're a seasoned developer, a designer, a tester, or just an enthusiast, there's a place for you in
          the
          open source community.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="card">
        <p>
        <ul style="line-height: 1.5rem; font-weight: 450;">
          <li>We code for real-world open-source projects.</li>
          <li>It refines our existing knowledge of programming and also helps us to learn new skills.</li>
          <li>Many open-source projects offer mentorship programs to guide and help us through our first few
            contributions.</li>
          <li>We need not develop the whole thing from scratch, we just have to fork our favorite projects and
            start
            experimenting with them.</li>
          <li>After making any open-source contribution, we get immediate feedback regarding our developmental
            work.</li>
          <li>While doing open-source contributions, we interact with like-minded developers from all over the
            world
            and build connections along the way.</li>
          <li>As we get more closer to the open-source community, we get to know much more about our field of
            interest
            and other related fields.</li>
          <li>The most important aspect of open-source contributions is It may fetch us a job in our field of
            interest.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          Hence, a large number of students are heading towards open-source contributions because these days
          quality
          open-source contributions in some good projects are seen as an alternative to the good internships
          with
          developer's profile. The reason is we get the same kind of exposure to work and learn the required
          skills
          for software development like any good internships at Google or Microsoft.
        </p>

      <h3 class="head">Conclusion :</h3>
      <div class="card" style="background-color: #121653; color: rgb(3, 0, 98); font-weight: 500;">

        <p>To dive into open source, start by exploring projects that align with your interests or areas you
          want to
          learn more about. Familiarize yourself with version control systems like Git and platforms like
          GitHub,
          as
          they are integral to the collaborative nature of open source development. Don't be afraid to ask
          questions,
          participate in discussions, and contribute in any way you can - every contribution, no matter how
          small,
          is
          valuable. <br><br>
          As you immerse yourself in the open source community, you'll discover a rich ecosystem of learning
          resources, events, and supportive individuals who share a passion for openness and collaboration.
          Welcome to
          the world of open source - where innovation knows no bounds, and the collective effort of many
          shapes
          the
          future of technology!</p>
